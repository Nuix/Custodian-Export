<h1 id="label-Overview">Overview</h1>

<p><strong>Written By:</strong> mrk</p>

<p>This script exports the selected items by performing a series of custodian
based exports. Each export includes natives, using item name with path, and
exporting all messages to a single PST file. After separately exporting
each custodian&#39;s items, the script moves the reports to their own
directory and generates a summary-report.xml of the separate exports.</p>

<h1 id="label-Getting+Started">Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="label-Setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Begin by downloading the latest release of this code. Extract the contents
of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory. In Windows the script
directory is likely going to be either of the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts</code> - User level script directory</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts</code> - System level script directory</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Before running the script you will need to have a case open in Nuix and a
selection of items which you wish to work with.</p>

<p>The script will prompt the user to select a directory to be used as the
export destination. Within this export destination, the script will create
a summary-report.xml file, and &#39;Export&#39; and &#39;Reports&#39;
directories, each containing separate folders for each custodian&#39;s
export and report.</p>

<h3 id="label-Export+Items">Export Items</h3>

<p>This script exports the top level item for each of the selected items.
Items that have no top-level item will also be included. Multiple items
which resolve to the same top-level item will result in a single item in
the export, so the exported items may be smaller than the number of
selected items.</p>

<p>Each custodian is exported separately into folders named for the custodian.
If any of the items do not have an assigned custodian, the export is
canceled.</p>

<h3 id="label-Export+Product">Export Product</h3>

<p>Each export includes natives, named using the item name with path, and PST
mail format.</p>

<h3 id="label-Reports">Reports</h3>

<p>After the per-custodian exports complete, all their output (i.e.
summary-report.txt/xml and top-level-MD5-digests.txt) is moved to the
reports directory (maintaining the custodian folders).</p>

<p>A new summary-report.xml is created in the export destination, summarizing
the separate per-custodian exports. The summary report.xml file contain
details of the export operation, including: - The exact legal export
configuration. - Detailed breakdowns of all files that were exported. -
Timing information for each of the custodian exports. - Detailed file type
statistics. - Details of all duplicate top-level items not exported. - A
fully qualified query string that can be used to find all items that failed
to export correctly.</p>

<p>After exporting items to a legal load file format, review the associated
summary report to ensure the content of the export meets expectations.</p>
